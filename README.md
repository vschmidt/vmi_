# :hotsprings: Introduction

This project was a joint effort to help develop a low cost oxygen mix using the Arduino platform.

# :fire: Squematic

All the squematic and system eletronic simulation are in "\*.pdsprj"  file.

# :hammer: How do use?

1. Make the circuit present in squematic
2. Upload "\*.ino" code to your board

# :test_tube: Try it

You can improve this code and use it in other servo controller projects.
